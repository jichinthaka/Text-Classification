Introduction
In this programming assignment, you should implement the following text classification systems for the given data set. The attached paper explains the data set, and sets the baseline. 

1. A traditional ML classifier s.a. SVM or Logistic Regression with at least 5  of the features mentioned in the paper.

2. A traditional ML classifier s.a. SVM or Logistic Regression with word embedding features s.a. word2vec or fasttext.

3. A NN classifier s.a. an LSTM for classification

4. BONUS - experiment with a BERT-based classifier

Use 10-fold cross validation to evaluate your model.  Record precision, recall, and F-score of each of the dialog act in the corpus, and the accuracy and the confusion matrix of the classifiers.  Compare the results of the three classifiers.

A python script containing the code (all code should be in one script) with clear execution instructions  should be provided.
